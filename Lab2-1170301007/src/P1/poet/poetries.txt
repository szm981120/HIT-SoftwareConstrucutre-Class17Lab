The noisy market is the window of the museum
In the afternoon a bright exhibit
I have been walking around in this city
Add some chaos to the street
Shopping in the shop
Stop at the mall to discover
My action is being repeated
Put on seasonal clothes
Cover an illusion
Looks like there is no situation
Under the clothes
I often slip away
Go to your own rental house to sing
Leave an empty street figure
Give the world silver packaging
Is a kind of labor
Carrying endless cotton when you come
In the wild
I am another kind of snowman
Under the snow
The voice is adding flesh and blood to me
Liu Zongyuans hook to the river
Fishing your body
What do you say when you are out of the water
I do not understand
And my questioning passed through your transparent ears
This scenario
No need to explain just a sleep
Single thing brings lost language
I am sitting under the branches
I want to explain in your language
The blush on my face is not because of excitement
The building in the south is a small stove that I suddenly miss
This is a small stove that a woman suddenly misses
Her feet are cold and she can't keep four secrets in her mouth

Itâ€™s a small stove at night
My loneliness is on my head
To the forgotten grandmother
Picking up her pure love

Small stove
a fish swimming in the fire
The fire is going to take the fence and knees like wood
Love is an event of rapid movement
Like the wind the wind blowing in the face
Elephant eagle
Like lightning you just discovered a hidden lightning
Since then everything
No longer the same as before

Love is the leopard of Rilke
Going over the iron fence
And you are crossing the iron grid
Looking at the eye of the leopard with green light
Waiting or dying

Love is big tree
Is oak and green maple
All branches are staggered in the sky
Is a small flower under the tree
The flower is beginning to bloom in the dew
Lace grass
There is a tomb in the bush.
Two people in the tomb are lying quietly

Both people are recalling
The night of the first date
Lying in the grass
Counting the stars
I want to be a loyal son in the distance.
And material short lover
Like all poets who dream of being horses
I have to walk in the same way with the martyrs and clowns.
On the road

Everyone has to put out the fire. I am alone.
Fire up
This fire is big, it blooms in the sacred motherland.
Like all poets who dream of being horses
I used this fire to get a lifetime of dark nights.

This fire is the language and rock of the great motherland.
Liangshan City Walled Village
Dreams are in Dunhuang, and July will be cold.
Skeleton
Such as white firewood and hard strips of white snow
Placed in the mountains of the gods
Like all poets who dream of being horses
I am putting this fire. These three are imprisoning my lamp.
Spit

Everyone has to walk from my knife to build the motherland.
 language
I am willing to start from scratch.
And so like a poet who dreams of being a horse
I would also like to sit on the bottom.

Only the most immortal of the creations of the gods, with no
Resistible rate of death
Only food is my cherished, I hold her tightly
Hug her to have children in her hometown
Like all poets who dream of being horses
I also wish to bury myself in the high mountains around me.
Watching the calm home

I am infinitely faced with the big river.
I am a little tired in my life.
Like all poets who dream of being horses
There is no drop in the water, there is no drop in the water.
The horse is returning to heaven

If I reborn in the riverbank of the motherland after the millennium
After the millennium, I once again own the rice fields of China.
Snow mountain with Zhou Tianzi
I choose an eternal career

My career is to be the life of the sun.
He has been brilliant since ancient times.
Incomparable light
Like all poets who dream of being horses
At last
I was carried into the immortal sun by the gods at dusk

The sun is my name
The sun is my life
The top of the sun is buried
The body of poetry
The Millennium Kingdom and me
Riding a five-thousand-year-old phoenix and the dragon named Ma
I will fail
But the poem itself will win with the sun.
